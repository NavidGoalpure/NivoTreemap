This test project displays the status of the cryptocurrency market using a Treemap chart. Instead of real-time data, it uses mock data to demonstrate the functionality. The project utilizes the Nivo npm library, a powerful data visualization library for React, to create the Treemap chart.

## Features

- Generates a Treemap chart showcasing the market capitalization and relative sizes of various cryptocurrencies.
- Uses mock data for demonstration purposes.
- Interactive chart with tooltips displaying detailed information for each cryptocurrency.

## Technologies Used

- React.js for front-end development.
- [Nivo](https://nivo.rocks/) library for creating the Treemap chart.

## Mock Data Source

The mock data used in this project is stored locally in the file `src/Const.tsx`. You can modify this file to test different scenarios or use real data from an API if needed.
